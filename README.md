# Spack and Easybuild web stats

Exported data from Google's Universal Analytics (UA) from spack and easybuild.

## Why?

Universal analytics went away on July 1, 2024. This is an export in case we ever want to
look at the data again.

## What?

There is data here from:

* Spack:
  * [spack.readthedocs.io](https://spack.readthedocs.io): `2017-06-17` to `2022-11-12`
  * [spack.io](https://spack.io): `2017-06-17` to `2023-07-16`
  * [spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io): `2019-10-27` to `2023-07-04`

Easybuild:
  * [easybuild.readthedocs.io](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io): `2016-08-23` to `2023-01-28`

The dates ranges are those for which universal analytics was active on these sites,
ending either when the sites switched to GA4 or when UA stopped collecting data.
